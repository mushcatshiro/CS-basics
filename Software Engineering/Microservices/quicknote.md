# quicknote

- side car pattern - main container handles business logic and sub container handles eg. transferring logs to centralized server.
- ambassador - instead of talking to another service directly, talks to a proxy ambassador, something like a service discovery service?
- adaptor - a reversed ambassador, which simplifies the outside world's view of the inner server
- service mesh - or service discovery
- repo pattern - where instead of having crud in functional programming we could do by OOP approach [Github example](https://github.com/lastlegion/Python_Microservices_Meetup/blob/master/todo_app/v2/repository/todo_repository.py)
- producer and consumer pattern with rabbitmq - [Github example](https://github.com/scalablescripts/python-microservices)
