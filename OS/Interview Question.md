## 1. python (c) data type and sizes

- 8 bit = 1 byte
- bool -> one byte
- int (signed) -> default 32bits, support 8, 16, 32, 64
- uint (unsigned) -> default 32bits, support 8, 16, 32, 64
- float -> default 64 bits, support 16, 32, 64
- string -> 8 bit
- time -> date time default 64 bits, support 32 and 64

we cant get directly get the size from python as it depends on the underlying machine architecture, read up [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49318826/getting-size-of-primitive-data-types-in-python).
